#Identify stalling position

This program identifies the stalling nucleotide for a table of sigma 70 transcription units ([table here](http://biocyc.org/group?id=biocyc12-8696-3642327439)). This program can be run on different promoters too.

The repo includes attached the script with input files and output file. The output (StallingPositionEcoCycSigma70.csv) contains gene Accession Numbers and which position stalling would occur if lacking U, A, T or G.

Requires a sequence.fast for the organism being investigate in the same directory as the python file.
